# SovereignForge Engineering Plan

Status: Day 5 prototype complete
Target: seven-day prototype  
Source brief: [`../details.md`](../details.md)

This folder is the implementation source of truth for **SovereignForge**, an on-premise agentic AI workbench for confidential industrial work. The plan intentionally optimizes for a reliable competition prototype, not a production-scale platform.

## Working rules

1. Scope is frozen to the three demo workflows and seven core capabilities.
2. A feature is complete only when its acceptance criteria and relevant tests pass.
3. AI-generated claims must be grounded in supplied files or explicitly marked as inference.
4. No cloud AI API or internet dependency is allowed during task execution.
5. Security controls must be enforced by code/container boundaries and demonstrated by tests.
6. New scope requires an explicit trade-off: remove or defer work of comparable effort.

## Decision authority

- Product scope and priority: product/technical lead.
- Architecture, data and security boundaries: technical lead.
- Acceptance evidence and release decision: technical lead plus QA owner.
- Demo narration may simplify wording but must not contradict measured behavior.

## Suggested repository target

scripts/               setup, health, seed and offline verification

docker-compose.yml     local orchestration
README.md              setup and operator quick start
```

## Change control

For material design changes, update the affected document, add an ADR in `13-risks-and-decisions.md`, and update traceability in `14-traceability-and-checklists.md`. Do not silently change a security boundary or acceptance criterion in code.
